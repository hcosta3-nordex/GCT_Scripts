Merge of TDSL40ms, OPClogger for both WEA and CWE
Filters for signals created. This feature relies on Filters.txt file, so please don't change the name and have it configured in the .bat/.py folder.
Filters should follow the example below. This is meant to be added to Filters.txt.

Test1,Test2,...
Signal1_Test1,Signal2_Test1,...
Signal1_Test2,Signal2_Test2,...

Notes: 
1)For turbine extraction check xml file. If in there the first FM is a spare you need to delete that line since that should be WEA system OK. Until bug is fixed, please have this in mind.
2)Older turbine Softwares only have, according to xml, 300 ana signals which might not be the case. If that's not the case just use a xml from a newer version with 768 ANA signals (this creates no problems with the extraction)
3)There was a bug on TSDL creation on NC2 that was just corrected with latest version, so if your park doesn't have this latest version St's won't be possible to extract, on TSDl version, because instead of writing the binary sum it was writing STWord_001[],STWord_002[]
